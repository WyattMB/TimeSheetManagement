# TimeSheetManagement
TimeSheetManagement webapp for python training
Before starting the AWS training I decided to restart the project to correct the structure.

As of 02/21 I have finished the time sheet part, and am working on the reports.
I got stuck pretty hard while working on the project during the AWS training because I wanted to force the user to create a profile at the same time as creating an auth_user.
I figured that out and finally got to move on to core functionality, which is what I've been working on over the weekend.

I will be finished with the plan I made for the project soon. Thank you for your patience.
